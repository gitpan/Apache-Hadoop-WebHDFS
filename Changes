        First version, released on an unsuspecting world. Note this is not 
        the full WebHDFS api as I needed something to write files to a secure 
        hadoop cluster using GSSAPI for authentication.   Current state is one
        can read & write files/directories to HDFS.  One can also get a delegation
        token.  See POD for further information on implemented methods.
