Apache-Hadoop-WebHDFS

This module provides a perl interface to Hadoop's WebHDFS API, allowing one to 
both read and write files to HDFS with perl.  Apache-Hadoop-WebHDFS supports
both unsecure and secure grids by using GSSAPI.

LWP::Authen::Negotiate is the magic sauce for working with secure hadoop clusters
parent                 included with Perl 5.10.1 and newer 
File::Map              is used for mmap'ing files instead of slurping
